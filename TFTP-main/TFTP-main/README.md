# TFTP
Developed a TFTP client-server in C supporting connect, get, put, mode, and exit commands. Server runs in the background silently. Implemented Normal (512-byte), Octet (byte-by-byte), and Netascii (newline conversion) modes using UDP sockets, file I/O, and system calls for efficient file transfer.
